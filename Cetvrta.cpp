/*
Mirko needs to choose four points in the plane so that they form a rectangle with sides parallel to the axes. He has already chosen three points and is confident that he hasnâ€™t made a mistake, but is having trouble locating the last point. Help him.
Input

Each of the three points already chosen will be given on a separate line. All coordinates will be integers between 1
and 1000

.
Output

Output the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the rectangle.
