/*
You are part of a team developing software to help students learn basic mathematics. You are to write one part of that software, which is to display possibly improper fractions as mixed fractions. A proper fraction is one where the numerator is less than the denominator; a mixed fraction is a whole number followed by a proper fraction. For example the improper fraction 27/12 is equivalent to the mixed fraction 2 3/12. You should not reduce the fraction (i.e. don’t change 3/12 to 1/4).
Input

Input has one test case per line. Each test case contains two integers in the range [1,231−1]
. The first number is the numerator and the second is the denominator. A line containing 0 0

will follow the last test case.
Output

For each test case, display the resulting mixed fraction as a whole number followed by a proper fraction, using whitespace to separate the output tokens.
